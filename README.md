# Expanding the Faust ecosystem

The Faust project continues to grow through a open-source ecosystem of developers, researchers, artists, and teachers. This repository serves as a collaborative hub for initiatives that expand the reach, capabilities, and accessibility of Faust by proposing different research and development topics. 

## Overview

Faust is not only a language for real-time signal processing. Is is also a platform that bridges research, education, and production across many domains: web audio, embedded systems, sound synthesis, interactive installations, and machine learning.  

To keep the ecosystem evolving, [GRAME](https://www.grame.fr) and the wider Faust community regularly propose, mentor, and support open-source development projects through initiatives such as [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](GSOC.md) and the [Faust Ideas List](IDEAS.md).

## Google Summer of Code

Faust has been an active participant in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) since 2022. Each year, new contributors join to implement ambitious projects that consolidate the Faust ecosystem—creating new tools, backends, integrations, and educational resources.

Examples of recent GSoC work include:
- Integration of **automatic differentiation** for Differentiable DSP (DDSP) in Faust.
- Development of **Faust Package Manager** for managing DSP libraries.
- Integrations of Faust into platforms such as **Cables.gl**, **Godot** and **Wwise**.
- New tools such as `faust2clap`, `faust2surge`, and `faust2webaudio`.
- A **VS Code Language Server and Formatter** for improved developer experience.

These projects are documented in detail in [GSOC.md](GSOC.md), which includes descriptions, expected outcomes, required skills, and mentoring contacts. Each contribution strengthens the foundation of Faust and helps make high-level audio programming more accessible and powerful.

## The Ideas List

The [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) document gathers ongoing and future ideas for extending the Faust ecosystem.   It functions as a **living roadmap** for experimental features, integrations, and research directions. Many of these ideas can become GSoC projects or independent community initiatives.

Some current and past highlights include:
- **WebAssembly and WebGPU optimizations** to push Faust performance in the browser.
- **New deployment models** such as Progressive Web Apps and NPM-packaged web components.
- **Advanced DSP features** like invertible functions, hot-reloadable soundfiles, and PFFT-like wrappers.
- **Improved developer tools**, including better linear algebra support, UI declarations, and `faust2nihplug` for Rust.
- **Creative projects** such as modal reverb modeling, modular synthesis, and AI/LLM-based integrations.
